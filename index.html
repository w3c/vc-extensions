    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
This document serves as an unofficial directory for all known Verifiable
Credential specifications whether they are released by a global standards
setting organization, a community group, an open source project, or an
individual.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h1>Adding a Specification Entry</h1>
      <p>
  The Verifiable Credentials Data Model is designed to be extended by 3rd party
  specifications to address a variety of real world use cases. Examples of
  extensions include, but are not limited to, new types of Verifiable Credentials
  and ways of expressing credential status, schema validation, evidence,
  refreshing, terms of use, and cryptographic suites for securing credentials. In
  order to add a new specification to this directory, an implementer submits a
  modification request for this directory, as a pull request on the repository
  where this directory is hosted, where the modification request adheres to the
  following policies:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
  Any addition to the directory MUST conform to the
  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-specs-directory/tooling/specification-entry.yml">
  JSON Schema for a directory entry</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
  If there are copyright, trademark, or any intellectual property rights
  concerns, the addition and use MUST be authorized in writing by the intellectual
  property rights holder under a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing">F/RAND</a>
  license. Examples include specifications that use trademarked brand names,
  property names that utilize the titles of copyrighted works, and patented
  technology that would cause the use of the extension to require licensing a
  patent.
        </li>
        <li>
  Any addition MUST NOT create unreasonable legal, security, moral, or privacy
  issues that will result in direct harm to others. Examples of unacceptable
  additions include any containing racist language, technologies used to
  persecute minority populations, and unconsented pervasive tracking.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
  The Editors of this directory MUST consider all of the policies above when
  reviewing additions to the directory and MUST reject directory entries if they
  violate any of the policies in this section. Entities registering additions can
  challenge rejections first with the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group and
  then, if they are not satisfied with the outcome, with the W3C Staff. W3C Staff
  need not be consulted on changes to the directory, but do have the final
  authority on directory contents. This is to ensure that W3C can adequately
  respond to time sensitive legal, privacy, security, moral, or other pressing
  concerns without putting an undue operational burden on W3C Staff.
      </p>

      <p>
  Any submission to the directory that meets all of the criteria listed above will
  be accepted for inclusion. The specifications listed in this directory enumerate
  all known specifications, without choosing between them.
