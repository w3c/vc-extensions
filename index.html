    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>
This document serves as an unofficial directory for all known Verifiable
Credential specifications whether they are released by a global standards
setting organization, a community group, an open source project, or an
individual.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h1>Adding a Specification Entry</h1>
      <p>
  The Verifiable Credentials Data Model is designed to be extended by 3rd party
  specifications to address a variety of real world use cases. Examples of
  extensions include, but are not limited to, new types of Verifiable Credentials
  and ways of expressing credential status, schema validation, evidence,
  refreshing, terms of use, and cryptographic suites for securing credentials.
     </p>
     <p> In
  order to add a new specification to this directory, an implementer submits a
  modification request for this directory, as a pull request on the repository
  where this directory is hosted.
  </p>

  Here is an example:

  <p>
  <pre class="example">
{
  "name": "Example VC",
  "summary": "Used to demonstrate examples for Verifiable Credentials.",
  "specification": "https://example.github.io/example-spec/",
  "category": "vc",
  "maintainerEmail": "maintainer@community.example",
  "maintainerName": "Example Community Group",
  "maintainerWebsite": "https://example.github.io/",
  "vocabulary": ["https://example.github.io/vocabularies/example.yml"]
}
  </pre>
  </p>
  <p>
  The modification request MUST adhere to the following policies:
  </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
Any addition to the directory MUST conform to Section
<a href="#specification-entry-format"></a>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there are copyright, trademark, or any intellectual property rights
concerns, the addition and use MUST be authorized in writing by the intellectual
property rights holder under a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing">F/RAND</a>
license. Examples include specifications that use trademarked brand names,
property names that utilize the titles of copyrighted works, and patented
technology that would cause the use of the extension to require licensing a
patent.
        </li>
        <li>
Any addition MUST NOT create unreasonable legal, security, moral, or privacy
issues that will result in direct harm to others. Examples of unacceptable
additions include any containing racist language, technologies used to
persecute minority populations, and unconsented pervasive tracking.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
The Editors of this directory MUST consider all of the policies above when
reviewing additions to the directory and MUST reject directory entries if they
violate any of the policies in this section. Entities registering additions can
challenge rejections first with the W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group and
then, if they are not satisfied with the outcome, with the W3C Staff. W3C Staff
need not be consulted on changes to the directory, but do have the final
authority on directory contents. This is to ensure that W3C can adequately
respond to time sensitive legal, privacy, security, moral, or other pressing
concerns without putting an undue operational burden on W3C Staff.
      </p>

      <p>
Any submission to the directory that meets all of the criteria listed above will
be accepted for inclusion. The specifications listed in this directory enumerate
all known specifications, without choosing between them.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h1>Specification Entry Format</h1>
        <p>
The specification entry format MUST conform to the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-specs-dir/tooling/specification-entry.yml">
JSON Schema for a specification entry</a>. Each field is documented below:
        </p>
        <table class="simple">
          <thead>
            <th>Field</th>
            <th>Description</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>name</td>
              <td>
A short human readable name for the specification. For example: `Status List
(v2021)`.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>summary</td>
              <td>
A one sentence description for the specification. For example: `A credential
status list with herd privacy characteristics.`
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>specification</td>
              <td>
An URL that resolves to a human readable specification. For example:
`https://w3c.github.io/vc-status-list-2021/`.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>category</td>
              <td>
The Verifiable Credential extension category of the specification, which can
be one of the following values: `credentialStatus`, `credentialSchema`,
`evidence`, `proof`, `refreshService`, `termsOfUse`, or `vc`.
For example: `credentialStatus`.
              <p class="note">
The extensions might define a `@type`. See [[JSON-LD11]].
              </p>
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>maintainerName</td>
              <td>
A person or organization which responds to contact requests. For example:
`W3C Verifiable Credentials Working Group`.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>maintainerEmail</td>
              <td>
An email to send contact requests. For example:
`public-vc-wg@w3.org`.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>maintainerWebsite</td>
              <td>
An website to send contact requests. For example:
`https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc`.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>vocabulary</td>
              <td>
An array of URLs that contain machine-readable vocabulary information in
yml2vocab or JSON-LD format. For example:
`["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/vc-status-list-2021/main/contexts/v1.jsonld"]`.
              </td>
